# Random Password Generator

## Description
This application can be used to generate a password as short as 8 characters and as long as 128 characters. The actual size and characters in use will depend on user input. It's main purpose is to aid in the creation of hard to guess passwords and can be used as often as is required.

Throughout this project I have learned how to create and call functions and manipulate arrays in order to make the application work.
